# Tip 1 - Paradigm Types
1. Structured Paradigm
    - Because use of unrestrained jumps (goto statements) is
        harmful to program structure, replaced those jumps with the more familiar if/then/else and
        do/while/until constructs.
    - Focuses on organizing code into logical structures.
    - Emphasizes the use of loops, conditionals, and functions.
2. Object-Oriented Paradigm
    Two **programmers**
    noticed that the function call stack frame in the ALGOL language could be
    moved to a heap, thereby allowing local variables declared by a function to
    exist long after the function returned. The function became a **constructor** for
    a class, the local variables became **instance** variables, and the nested functions
    became **methods**. This led inevitably to the discovery of **_polymorphism_**
    through the disciplined use of function pointers.
