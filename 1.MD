# Tip 1 - Paradigm Types
1. Structured Paradigm
    - Because use of unrestrained jumps (goto statements) is
        harmful to program structure, replaced those jumps with the more familiar if/then/else and
        do/while/until constructs.
    - Focuses on organizing code into logical structures.
    - Emphasizes the use of loops, conditionals, and functions.
